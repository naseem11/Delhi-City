            <h2>Places to Eat</h2>
            <p>Delhi has history and culture to spare, but for all the museums and ruins, one of the best reasons to linger in the capital is to satisfy your belly. Delhiites love to eat, and visitors will find that life in the city is a constant dipping buffet. In between dining in nationally-renowned temples of gastronomy, locals will pause at roadside stalls for plates of chaat (Indian-style salad) and pakora, or slip into backstreet canteens for the city's finest, fresh-from-the-tandoor kebabs. Most midrange and all upmarket restaurants charge a service tax of around 10%, while drinks taxes can suck a further 20% (alcoholic) or 12.5% (nonalcoholic) from your moneybelt.</p>

               <p>Grander and more majestic than ever, the recently renovated Dum Pukht continues its legacy of Awadhi cuisine.The interior is suggestive of a bygone age, evoking a sense of old-world charm. The ornamental chandeliers add to the grand setting, a fitting backdrop for serving the 200-year old cuisine of the Awadhi Nawabs. Dum pukht is a process of cooking by steam, where the ingredients are literally cooked in their own juices to bring out true aromatic flavors. The heritage thus continues with a regal spread of sumptuous fare served by courses. Preparations like motia pulao rehmani, murgh chandi tikka, dum pukht badin jaan and shahi nehari are served with a variety of breads traditionally prepared in the tandoor in great presentation.<a href="http://www.itcwelcomgroup.in/welcomcuisine/dumpukht/cuisine_origin_brief.html" target="_blank">Know more..</a></p>

               <p>Soon to turn into a 24-hour restaurant, 1911 is a landmark year in the history of Delhi.It was in this year King-Emperor George V declared New Delhi as the Capital of India. The 1911 Restaurant pays tribute to this historic milestone with rich furnishings, choicely done up interiors and cuisine that showcases the ‘melting pot’ culture of Delhi. Although serving international cuisine, this restaurant prides itself on old Indian-style service, that of which one would expect in the time of the Orient. It is situated at The Imperial, a hotel with a long association with period art. In fact, 1911 is an ode to this tradition. It is replete with antiquities dating back to the 1911 Durbar, etchings of ink, stipple, lithographs, tints (mezzo and aqua) and photographs from the colonial era.<a href="https://theimperialindia.com/restaurant-menu/1911-restaurant/" target="_blank">Know more..</a></p>
